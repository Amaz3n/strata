> please review my app. This app will compete with apps such as procore and 
buildertrend, but at a smaller local scale in SWFL. I want my app to be a 
faster, modern, better alternative that makes our clients (the builders that
 will subscribe to this app) lives easier. With that in mind, I wanted to 
work on our financial set of features. I want you to create a gameplan of 
all the features you think our app should have (at least in a small scale) 
for covering our builders. I created a nice client portal, I have COs, 
invoices, but I'm probably missing more. I want to have killer features 
that'd make these people die to switch bc it's nicer and easier. Brainstorm.
 

⏺ I'll explore your current financial features to understand what you have,
  then brainstorm a comprehensive gameplan for killer financial features.

  The "Switch from Procore" Pitch

  "Procore costs $50k/year and takes 6 months to learn. Strata costs 
  $299/month, you're running in a day, and your clients can pay invoices 
  from a text message. Your accountant will love the QuickBooks sync. Your 
  homeowners will love the portal. You'll love knowing your profit margin in
   real-time."

  Questions to Consider

  1. Payment processing: Stripe vs. Square vs. both? ACH priority (lower
  fees)?
  2. QuickBooks: Online only, or Desktop too? (Desktop still common with
  older builders)
  3. Target segment: Custom homes? Remodels? Both? (Affects
  templates/workflows)
  4. Pricing model: Per project? Per user? Flat fee? Transaction fees?

  Want me to dive deeper into any of these features, or start implementing
  Phase 1?

> I would like you to build a detailed LLM-optimized gameplan to start 
implementing these, save it as an .md in the docs folder of the project. As 
for your questions, clients of builders will be paying big deposits and 
sending big sums of money, so I'd assume due to CC fees they'd probably 
prefer ACH/wires, regardless, I think we should have a payment processor 
like that, whichever integrates best and gives us more flexibility. QBO I 
think we should probably plan on both as you're right. 3. Local builders 
tend to do both, they tend to have new custom homes, remodels, estate 
management, and more diviosions. You mean my pricing model for this app? I'm
 thinking of doing a flat fee most likely. You pay X and you can have your 
whole team on it. but I'm not set on it. any input is appreciated.
